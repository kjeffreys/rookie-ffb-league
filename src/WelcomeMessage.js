                <h2>Week 3 Game Previews</h2>
                <p>Alright, now for the fun part! Here's a preview of the epic battles lined up for Week 3.</p>

                <div className="game-preview">
                    <p>üèà <strong>Eric's Endzone Game (Eric) (1-1) vs The Maine Event (Craig) (0-2)</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Projected Scores: 121.98 - 114.88</em></p>
                    <p>Great things come from Maine, and this week, both Eric and Craig are set to prove it. As the <strong>Rivaly of the Week</strong> heats up, who will get the chance to celebrate the other's victory? Stay tuned!</p>
                </div>
                <div className="game-preview">
                    <p>üèà <strong>Lucy's Head Coach (Kyle) (1-1) vs No Barkley No Bite (Bill) (2-0)</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Projected Scores: 108 - 125</em></p>
                    <p>This game figures to be less of a rivalry and more of a meat grinding. Kyle, who couldn't beat a lineup with sat out players last week, is hoping for mercy from Bill. Will Bill be merciful? No, he will not. Look away.</p>
                </div>
                <div className="game-preview">
                    <p>üèà <strong>Dean's Definitive Team (Dean) (0-2) vs The Unit (Dave and Rissa) (1-1)</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Projected Scores: 107 - 85</em></p>
                    <p>Dean is gearing up to wallop The Unit with the power of statistics, as he is projected to take the win this week. Meanwhile, Dave and Rissa showcased style by beating Kyle even with a player sitting out. Can they win with one hand tied behind their back again? Or will math seize the day?</p>
                </div>
                <div className="game-preview">
                    <p>üèà <strong>Lucy's Mom has got it going on (Joanna) (1-1) vs Espresso LoPrest(t)o (Alicen/Chris) (1-1)</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Projected Scores: 108 - 115</em></p>
                    <p>They're just too nice. I have no spice. To be continued...</p>
                </div>
                <div className="game-preview">
                    <p>üèà <strong>El Duderino (Luke) (1-1) vs Hanah's Nifty Team (Hanah) (2-0)</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Projected Scores: 120 - 107</em></p>
                    <p>Hanah is sitting atop the standings with only Bill sharing a 2-0 record. But Luke turned into a juggernaut against his own kin last week and is aiming to continue his streak. A battle not to be missed!</p>

                <h2>Changing Your Team Name</h2>
                <p>If you wish to spice things up a bit by changing your team name, follow these steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Navigate to 'My Team'</li>
                    <li>Click 'Edit Team Info'</li>

                <h2>Injured Reserve Note</h2>
                <p>If you have players with red letters next to them, they may be IR eligible. If they are just questionable and might play, or after a certain amount of weeks, they are not. But while they are, you can essentially put two people on a special IR bench for players who cannot play due to injury for a few weeks. This way, you have extra spots on your team while you pick up other players for current matches.</p>

                <p>However, this feature is reserved exclusively for injured players. If you're uncertain, try placing up to two players with red letters next to their names on IR. If the option isn't available, they are not eligible, indicating that they are likely a game-time decision and might still play. Feel free to message me if you're unsure about a specific player's eligibility or need assistance with this feature.</p>
