                <h2>Week 7 Game Previews</h2>
                <p>Alright, now for the fun part! Here's a preview of the epic battles lined up for Week 5.</p>

                <div className="game-preview">
                    <p>üèà <strong>Lucy's Head Coach (1-5-0 | 10th) vs Lucy's Mom has got it going on (1-5-0 | 9th)</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Projected Scores:</em> 107.87 to 99.77</p>
                    <p>In the most wholesome showdown ever, the sweetest couple in the league faces off! Who will win? Who cares! Either way, Lucy's family takes home the victory. ü•∞</p>
                </div>

                <div className="game-preview">
                    <p>üèà <strong>Dean's Definitive Team (3-3-0 | 6th) vs The Maine Event (3-3-0 | 5th)</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Projected Scores:</em> 106.09 to 110.28</p>
                    <p>Dean and The Maine Event are neck and neck in the rankings. This matchup will surely be a defining moment for both teams as they vie for dominance. üèÜ</p>
                </div>

                <div className="game-preview">
                    <p>üèà <strong>No Barkley All Bite (5-1-0 | 1st) vs Hanah's Nifty Team (5-1-0 | 2nd)</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Projected Scores:</em> 107.41 to 115.14</p>
                    <p>While the rest of us thought we were kids in a candy shop, Bill and Hanah just bulldozed the place with the kids inside. Now they will have to see what happens when they matchup against another great power and determine the frontrunner of the league. </p>
                </div>

                <div className="game-preview">
                    <p>üèà <strong>The Passion of the Christ(ian) (4-2-0 | 3rd) vs El Duderino (2-4-0 | 7th)</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Projected Scores:</em> 116.53 to 103.92</p>
                    <p>El Duderino needs a little less chill, while Eric has the passion but maybe a little less Christian McCaffrey this week.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="game-preview">
                    <p>üèà <strong>Espresso LoPres(t)o (4-2-0 | 4th) vs The Unit (Dave and Rissa) (2-4-0 | 8th)</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Projected Scores:</em> 103.17 to 77.57</p>
                    <p>Espresso LoPres(t)o seems poised for victory with a strong projected lead. Can The Unit's phantom team pull a Halloween upset? Or ill the LoPrestos keep their steam? </p>
                </div>


                <p>Best of luck to all in week 7!

                <p>If you wish to spice things up a bit by changing your team name, follow these steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Navigate to 'My Team'</li>
                    <li>Click 'Edit Team Info'</li>

            <section>
                <h2>Injured Reserve Note</h2>
                <p>If you have players with red letters next to them, they may be IR eligible. If they are just questionable and might play, or after a certain amount of weeks, they are not. But while they are, you can essentially put two people on a special IR bench for players who cannot play due to injury for a few weeks. This way, you have extra spots on your team while you pick up other players for current matches.</p>

                <p>However, this feature is reserved exclusively for injured players. If you're uncertain, try placing up to two players with red letters next to their names on IR. If the option isn't available, they are not eligible, indicating that they are likely a game-time decision and might still play. Feel free to message me if you're unsure about a specific player's eligibility or need assistance with this feature.</p>
