                <h2>Week 1 Game Previews</h2>
                <p>Alright, now for the fun part! Here's a preview of the epic battles lined up for Week 1.</p>
                <div className="game-preview">
                    <p>üèà <strong>Lucy's Head Coach (Kyle) vs El Duderino (Luke)</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Predicted scores: 114 - 119</em></p>
                    <p>A titanic clash to kick off the season! Will Lucy's Head Coach show El Duderino who the real Dude is or will Luke get Kyle demoted to Lucy's Assistant Coach? (which we all know he really is)</p>
                </div>

                <div className="game-preview">
                    <p>üèà <strong>Dean's Definitive Team (Dean) vs Hanah's Nifty Team</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Predicted scores: 110.9 - 110.6</em></p>
                    <p>Seems like Dean and Hanah spent a little too much time scrutinizing their teams instead of coming up with snazzy team names! This is a nail-biter in the making with a difference of mere decimals!</p>
                </div>

                <div className="game-preview">
                    <p>üèà <strong>No Barkley No Bite (Bill) vs The Maine Event (Craig)</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Predicted scores: 123 - 119</em></p>
                    <p>This is touted to be the highest scoring clash of the week. With 'No Barkley, does Bill still have a strong bite, or is he just fodder for The Maine Event‚Äôs upset? A thrilling encounter awaits!</p>
                </div>

                <div className="game-preview">
                    <p>üèà <strong>Eric's Endzone Endgame (Eric) vs Espresso LoPres(t)o (Alicen/Chris)</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Predicted scores: 120 - 119</em></p>
                    <p>Will Eric's strategic "endgame" maneuvers score a win against the caffeine-fueled rush of Espresso LoPres(t)o? Or will Alicen and Chris brew up a storm, leaving Eric in the froth? Get ready for a high-octane game!</p>
                </div>

                <div className="game-preview">
                    <p>üèà <strong>Lucy's Mom has Got it Going On (Joanna) vs The Unit (Dave and Rissa)</strong></p>
                    <p><em>Predicted scores: 113 - 109</em></p>
                    <p>Joanna's team seems to have an edge in the predictions, but will "The Unit" of Dave and Rissa show that two heads are indeed better than one? Or will Lucy's Mom continue to have it going on, right from week 1? It's a battle of wits and strategy!</p>
                </div>


                <p>It seems we have some close favorites for week 1, but everyone knows upsets are bound to happen (looking at you Luke üòâ).</p>

                <h2>Injured Reserve Note</h2>
                <p>If you have players with red letters next to them, they may be IR eligible. If they are just questionable and might play, or after a certain amount of weeks, they are not. But while they are, you can essentially put two people on a special IR bench for players who cannot play due to injury for a few weeks. This way, you have extra spots on your team while you pick up other players for current matches.</p>

                <p>However, this feature is reserved exclusively for injured players. If you're uncertain, try placing up to two players with red letters next to their names on IR. If the option isn't available, they are not eligible, indicating that they are likely a game-time decision and might still play. Feel free to message me if you're unsure about a specific player's eligibility or need assistance with this feature.</p>
